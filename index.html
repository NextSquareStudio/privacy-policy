        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 17, 2024</p>
        <p>Next Square Studio ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our players ("you"). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you purchase and play our game.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal data directly within our game. All transactions are processed through the platform you purchase from, which may collect personal information as required for transaction processing and other services. The information collected by these platforms may include your name, email address, payment information, and other data necessary for the purchase and download of our game.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>As we do not collect personal data, we do not use any such information for any purpose.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our game uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. The services used by our game include, but are not limited to, Google AdMob for displaying ads. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we use the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) to obtain your consent for personalized ads. You have the option to opt-out of personalized ads or accept non-personalized ads based on your preferences.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to ensuring the security of our game and the integrity of your experience. However, as we do not store or process your personal data, we rely on the security measures implemented by the platforms on which our game is available.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our game does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we might have inadvertently collected information from your child, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.</p>
        
        <h2>6. User Rights and GDPR Compliance</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These rights include the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Since we do not collect personal data directly, any requests regarding data should be directed to the platforms or services you interact with through our game.</p>
        <p>If you have consented to personalized ads and wish to change your preferences, you can do so through the privacy settings available in the game or by contacting us directly.</p>
